CBB.cpp and IP.cpp contain the source codes for the CBB and the LBC algorithms described in the paper, respectively. The corresponding “cpp” file needs to be compiled using a C++ compiler (such as Visual Studio). Then, the generated executable file, network files, and a text file titled “filename.txt” containing the filenames of networks need to be included in the same folder in order to run the algorithm.
