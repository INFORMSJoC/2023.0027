CBB.cpp and IP.cpp contain the source codes for the CBB and the LBC algorithms proposed in the paper, respectively. To run each algorithm, you need to compile the corresponding “cpp” file by using any C++ compiler ( such as Visual Studio). An executive file will be generated for the algorithm. Then, you need to include the generated executable file, network files, and a text file titled “filename.txt” containing the filenames of networks in the same folder. You can then run the executable file to start the algorithm.
